    "# BERT Fine-tuning on IPU\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate how to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model with PyTorch on the Graphcore IPU-POD16 system. We will use a BERT-Large model and fine-tune on the SQuADv1 Question/Answering task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show how to take a BERT model written in PyTorch from the 🤗`transformers` library from HuggingFace and parallelize and run it on IPU using PopTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an advanced tutorial: if you are new to PopTorch, we have a [PopTorch basics tutorial](https://github.com/graphcore/tutorials/tree/master/tutorials/pytorch/tut1_basics) that you can do first.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this Jupyter notebook on a remote IPU machine:\n",
    "1. Enable a Poplar SDK environment (see the [Getting Started](https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/getting-started.html) guide for your IPU system) and install required packages with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "2. In the same environment, install the Jupyter notebook server: `python -m pip install notebook`\n",
    "3. Launch a Jupyter Server on a specific port: `jupyter-notebook --no-browser --port <port number>`\n",
    "4. Connect via SSH to your remote machine, forwarding your chosen port:\n",
    "`ssh -NL <port number>:localhost:<port number> <your username>@<remote machine>`\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details about this process, or if you need troubleshooting, see our [guide on using IPUs from Jupyter notebooks](../../standard_tools/using_jupyter/README.md).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT fine-tuning is when you train a BERT model on a supervised learning task on a relatively small amount of data, by using starting weights obtained from pre-training on a large, generic text corpus. Pre-training of BERT requires a lot of unlabelled data (for instance all of Wikipedia + thousands of books) and a lot of compute. It is expensive and time-consuming, but after pre-training BERT will have learned an extremely good language model that can be fine-tuned on downstream tasks with small amount of labeled data, achieving great results.\n",

    "![bert.png](static/bert.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will fine-tune BERT (pre-trained on IPU with the Wikipedia dataset) on a question answering task called SQuAD. Then we will perform inference on the accompanying validation dataset.\n",
