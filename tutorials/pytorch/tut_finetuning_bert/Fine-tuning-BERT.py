# # BERT Fine-tuning on IPU
#
# This notebook will demonstrate how to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model with PyTorch on the Graphcore IPU-POD16 system. We will use a BERT-Large model and fine-tune on the SQuADv1 Question/Answering task.
#
# We will show how to take a BERT model written in PyTorch from the ðŸ¤—`transformers` library from HuggingFace and parallelize and run it on IPU using PopTorch.
#
# This is an advanced tutorial: if you are new to PopTorch, we have a [PopTorch basics tutorial](https://github.com/graphcore/tutorials/tree/sdk-release-2.5/tutorials/pytorch/tut1_basics) that you can do first.
#
# Requirements:
# - A Poplar SDK environment enabled
#    (see the [Getting Started](https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/getting-started.html) guide for your IPU system)
# - Python packages installed with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

# %pip install -r requirements.txt
# To run this Jupyter notebook on a remote IPU machine:
# 1. Enable a Poplar SDK environment (see the [Getting Started](https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/getting-started.html) guide for your IPU system) and install required packages with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
# 2. In the same environment, install the Jupyter notebook server: `python -m pip install jupyter`
# 3. Launch a Jupyter Server on a specific port: `jupyter-notebook --no-browser --port <port number>`
# 4. Connect via SSH to your remote machine, forwarding your chosen port:
# `ssh -NL <port number>:localhost:<port number> <your username>@<remote machine>`
#
# For more details about this process, or if you need troubleshooting, see our [guide on using IPUs from Jupyter notebooks](../../standard_tools/using_jupyter/README.md).
#
# ## Background
#
# BERT fine-tuning is when you train a BERT model on a supervised learning task on a relatively small amount of data, by using starting weights obtained from pre-training on a large, generic text corpus. Pre-training of BERT requires a lot of unlabelled data (for instance all of Wikipedia + thousands of books) and a lot of compute. It is expensive and time-consuming, but after pre-training BERT will have learned an extremely good language model that can be fine-tuned on downstream tasks with small amount of labeled data, achieving great results.
#
# ![image.png](attachment:image.png)
#
# In this notebook we will fine-tune BERT (pre-trained on IPU with the Wikipedia dataset) on a question answering task called SQuAD. Then we will perform inference on the accompanying validation dataset.

# ## 1. Get the data
#
#
# **What is SQuAD?**
#
# > Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.
#
# From https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/
#
# Basically you train a model to take a question and read a passage of text and predict the start and end positions of where that answer lies in the passage. The image below shows an example from the dataset:
#
# ![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)
#
# (Source: [Rajpurkar GitHub](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/explore/1.1/dev/Normans.html))
#
# For the case of SQuADv1 there are no unanswerable questions in the dataset.

# We use the ðŸ¤— `datasets` package to automatically download the SQuAD dataset

# In[ ]:


datasets = load_dataset("squad", cache_dir=Path.home() / ".torch/datasets/")


# The SQuAD dataset consists of pre-defined training and validation splits.

# In[4]:


datasets


# Each row in the data consists of a passage of text - `context` - a question about the passage - `question` - and the answer(s) to the question - `answers`. The latter consists of the text in the passage and the start position in the text.
#
# Here is an example row:

# In[5]:


datasets["train"][10016]


# **How do we preprocess this data to train it with a deep learning model?**
#
# We need to `tokenize` the text to turn it from words into numbers. This is done using `transformers.BertTokenizer`. Let's use this to tokenize a shortened version of the example above:

# In[6]:


# In[7]:


example = {"context": "Institutes of technology in Venezuela were developed in the 1950s",
           "question": "When were Institutes of technology developed?"}
tokenized_example = tokenizer(
    example["question"],
    example["context"],
    truncation="only_second",
    max_length=32,
    stride=16,
    return_overflowing_tokens=True,
    return_offsets_mapping=True,
    padding="max_length",
)


# In[8]:


tokenized_example.keys()


# Let's look at the `input_ids`:

# In[9]:


tokenized_example.input_ids[0]


# In[10]:


tokenizer.decode(tokenized_example.input_ids[0])


# As you can see in the decoded version, the question is placed at the start followed by a `[SEP]` token, then the context, followed by padding if required.

# In[11]:


# In[ ]:


train_dataset = datasets["train"].map(
    prepare_train_features,
    batched=True,
    num_proc=1,
    remove_columns=datasets["train"].column_names,
    load_from_cache_file=True,
)

# Create validation features from dataset

    num_proc=1,
    remove_columns=datasets["validation"].column_names,
    load_from_cache_file=True,
)


# ## 2. Get the Model and Parallelize on IPU-POD16

# We run the model on IPU using both **pipelining** and **data parallelism** in order to maximise hardware use.
#
# ### Parallelism through pipelining
#
# The model layers are split over 8 IPUs. We then use [*pipeline parallelism*](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tf-model-parallelism/en/latest/pipelining.html) over the IPUs with gradient accumulation. We subdivide the compute batch into micro-batches that pass through the pipeline in the forward pass and then come back again in the backwards pass, accumulating gradients for the parameters as they go.
#
# A complete pipeline step has a ramp-up phase the start and a ramp-down phase at the end. Increasing the gradient accumulation factor, increases the total batch size and also increases the pipeline efficiency, and therefore throughput, because the proportion of time in ramp-up/down phases will be reduced.
#
# ![image-3.png](attachment:image-3.png)
#
# ### Partitioning the Model
#
# BERT Large has 24 transformer layers, which we will split over our 8 IPUs. The embeddings, MLM projection layers, and the first 2 transformer layers sit on IPU0, the following 6 IPUs have 3 transformer layers each, and the last IPU has 4.
#
# ![image-4.png](attachment:image-4.png)
#
#
# ### Data Parallelism
#
# Ann IPU-POD16 contains 16 IPUs and our pipeline is 8 IPUs long. We can therefore replicate the pipeline, feeding two different micro-batches to the device, which doubles the effective mini-batch size. We call this configuration a "2x8 pipeline".
#
#
# ### Recomputation Checkpoints
#
# We can make more efficient use of the valuable In-Processor-Memory by saving only selected activation inputs and recomputing the rest. This lets us optimise on memory savings (by not storing all activations) vs FLOP expenditure (by not having to recompute all activations).
# ![image-7.png](attachment:image-7.png)
# Source: [TensorFlow Model Parallelism: Recomputation](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tf-model-parallelism/en/latest/pipelining.html#recomputation)
#
# Checkpoints are automatically placed between each pipeline stage. In addition to these automatic checkpoints, we are adding one at the end of every transformer layer, which leads to better performance.
#
# ### Replicated Tensor Sharding of Optimizer State
#
# As we are using multiple replicas (2 here), we can also distribute our optimizer state to reduce local memory usage, a method called [On-chip Replicated Tensor Sharding (RTS)](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/graphcore-glossary/en/latest/index.html#term-Replicated-tensor-sharding).
#
# > To further improve memory availability we also have the option to store tensors in the POD-IPU16 Streaming Memory at the cost of increased communications.

# We use the `poptorch.Dataloader` which is a drop-in replacement of `torch.Dataloader`, extending it with IPU specific options and asynchronous execution.
#
# Another small difference is the use of the `PadCollate` function. If `drop_last` option is false in a `DataLoader`, you may end up with a *remainder mini-batch* at the end of the epoch that is smaller than the other mini-batches.
#
# For a compiled device like IPU that would require a recompilation of the execution graph for that one mini-batch. In order to not lose any training examples, we can pad the remainder mini-batch with zeros and set the target values to a special value which will set the loss to 0 in those cases so they don't affect training. This way we have consistent mini-batch sizes and we can train on all the data.

# ## 6. Inference
#
# We can now use our fine-tuned model to answer questions. Let's start by defining a task:

# In[43]:


# Define task
question = "What speed-up can one expect from using sequence packing for training BERT on IPU?"
answer_text = "We find that at sequence length 512 padding tokens represent in excess of 50% of the Wikipedia"               "dataset used for pretraining BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)."              "Therefore by removing all padding we achieve a 2x speed-up in terms of sequences/sec."              "To exploit this characteristic of the dataset,"              "we develop and contrast two deterministic packing algorithms."


# Let's get the model inputs ready and create our model. We'll import the weights from the pre-trained, fine-tuned BERT model from the previous sections:

# In[44]:


# Apply the tokenizer to the input text, treating them as a text-pair.
input_encoding = tokenizer.encode_plus((question, answer_text))

# Extract inputs, add batch dimension
input_tensor = torch.tensor(input_encoding["input_ids"]).unsqueeze(0)
attention_tensor = torch.tensor(input_encoding["attention_mask"]).unsqueeze(0)
token_types = torch.tensor(input_encoding["token_type_ids"]).unsqueeze(0)

# Get model and load the fine-tuned weights
model = transformers.BertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(
    "checkpoints/squad_large_2x8")


# Optionally, instead of using the fine-tuned weights we saved in the previous section, you can download fine-tuned weights from the [Graphcore organisation on the HuggingFace Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore).

# In[ ]:


# model = transformers.BertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("Graphcore/bert-large-uncased-squad11")


# We can now solve the task and print the answer to the question:

# In[45]:


# Solve task
outputs = model(input_tensor, attention_tensor, token_types)

# Extract answer
answer_start, answer_stop = outputs.start_logits.argmax(), outputs.end_logits.argmax()
answer_ids = input_tensor.squeeze()[answer_start:answer_stop + 1]
answer_tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(
    answer_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
answer = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string(answer_tokens)

# Print results
print(f"Question: {question}")
print(f"Answer: {answer}")


# **That's it for today folks. We learned how to fine-tune a BERT-Large model on the SQuADv1.1 dataset to get SOTA performance. Our model can now answer questions.**
