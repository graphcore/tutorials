"""
This tutorial will present how PopTorch can help to efficiently load data to
your model and how to avoid common performance bottlenecks when passing data
from the host to the IPU. It also covers the more general notion of data
batching on IPUs which is also relevant to other frameworks.
"""
"""
Requirements:

- A Poplar SDK environment enabled (see the [Getting
  Started](https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/software.html#getting-started)
  guide for your IPU system)
- The PopTorch Python library installed (see
  [Installation](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poptorch-user-guide/en/latest/installation.html)
  of the PopTorch User Guide)
"""
"""
To run the Jupyter notebook version of this tutorial:

1. Enable a Poplar SDK environment
2. In the same environment, install the Jupyter notebook server:
   `python -m pip install jupyter`
3. Launch a Jupyter Server on a specific port:
   `jupyter-notebook --no-browser --port <port number>`
4. Connect via SSH to your remote machine, forwarding your chosen port:
   `ssh -NL <port number>:localhost:<port number>
   <your username>@<remote machine>`

## PyTorch and PopTorch DataLoader
"""
"""
If you are familiar with PyTorch you may have used
[torch.utils.data.DataLoader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader).

PopTorch provides [its own
DataLoader](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poptorch-user-guide/en/latest/batching.html#poptorch-dataloader)
which is a wrapper around `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`. It accepts the same
arguments as PyTorch's DataLoader with some extra features specific to the IPU:

- It takes a `poptorch.Options` instance to use IPU-specific features;
- It automatically computes the number of elements consumed by
  [one step](#how-many-samples-will-then-be-loaded-in-one-step);
- It enables asynchronous data loading.

See the
[documentation](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poptorch-user-guide/en/latest/batching.html#poptorch-asynchronousdataaccessor)
for more information about asynchronous mode.

## Understanding batching with IPU
"""
"""
When developing a model for the IPU, you will encounter different notions of
batching including mini-batches, replica batches and global batches. This
section will explain how these hyperparameters are related to the IPU and how
to compute the number of samples the DataLoader is going to fetch for one step.
"""
"""
### Device iterations
"""
"""
This diagram represents a basic execution on 1 IPU with
***n*** device iterations and 1 mini-batch used per iteration.

![Device Iterations](static/iterations.png)

A device iteration corresponds to one iteration of the training loop executed
on the IPU, starting with data-loading and ending with a weight update.
In this simple case, when we set ***n*** `deviceIterations`, the host will
prepare ***n*** mini-batches in an infeed queue so the IPU can perform
efficiently ***n*** iterations.

From the host point of view, this will correspond to a single call to the
model (1 step):

> ```python
> training_model(data, labels)
> ```
"""
"""
#### A note on returned data
"""
"""
The number of batches of data returned to the host depends on the option
`poptorch.Options.outputMode`. It defaults to `Final` for `trainingModel` and
`All` for `inferenceModel`. This is because you will usually want to receive
all the output tensors when you use a `inferenceModel()` while you will often
not need to receive all or any of the output tensors when you use a
`trainingModel`. See the
[documentation](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poptorch-user-guide/en/latest/reference.html?highlight=anchormode#poptorch.Options.outputMode)
for more information about `poptorch.Options.outputMode`.

In this case presented above, we are using a `trainingModel` and
`poptorch.Options.outputMode` is therefore the default value `Final`. Since
`poptorch.Options.replicationFactor` defaults to 1, the number of data elements
returned to the host will just be 16, which is the batch size. The tensor shape
will then be (16, 1, 128, 128).
"""
"""
### Gradient accumulation
"""
"""
This parameter must be used with pipelining. A pipelined model consists in
splitting the graph into different successive computation stages. Every stage
of a pipelined model can be placed on a different IPU, they all compute
specific parts of the graph with their own weights. Each stage will compute the
forward and backward pass of a mini-batch.

In the image below, we can see a 4 stage pipeline where 8 mini-batches
(`B1`-`B8`) are being processed:

- An `f` suffix indicates a forward pass;
- A `b` suffix indicates a backward pass.

![Gradient accumulation](static/pipeline.png)

When we set up a pipelined execution, we overcome the cost of having multiple
stages by computing several batches in parallel when the pipeline is full.
"""
"""
Every pipeline stage needs to update its weights when the gradients are ready.
However, it would be very inefficient to update them after each mini-batch
completion. The solution is the following:
After each backward pass the gradients are accumulated together for ***K***
mini-batches. Then, the accumulators are used to update the stage weights.
This is gradient accumulation. This value can be set in PopTorch via the
option `opts.Training.gradientAccumulation(K)`

In the previous part, we only had 1 mini-batch per weight update. This time we
have ***K*** mini-batches per weight update.

Then, for one device iteration with pipeline we have multiplied the number of
samples processed by ***K***.

More information about gradient accumulation can be found [in the PopTorch User
Guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poptorch-user-guide/en/latest/batching.html#poptorch-options-training-gradientaccumulation).
"""
"""
### Replication
"""
"""
![Replication](static/replica.png)

Replication describes the process of running multiple instances of the same
model simultaneously on different IPUs to achieve data parallelism. This can
give large improvements in throughput, as the training data is processed in
parallel.

In a single device iteration, many mini-batches may be processed and the
resulting gradients accumulated. We call this total number of samples processed
for one optimiser step the **global batch size**.

If the model requires ***N*** IPUs and the replication factor is ***M***,
***N*** x ***M*** IPUs will be necessary, but for one device iteration we have
increased by ***M*** the number of mini-batches processed.

The PopTorch Dataloader will ensure that the host is sending each replica a
different subset of the dataset.
"""
"""
### Global batch size
"""
"""
Because several mini-batches can be processed by one device iteration (that is,
for one weight update), we call **global batch size** this total number of
samples:

- Mini-batch size (sometimes called micro-batch)

  - The number of samples processed by one simple fwd/bwd pass.

- Replica batch size

  - The number of samples on a single replica process before weight update
    Replica batch size = *Mini-batch size* x Gradient accumulation factor

- Global batch size

  - The number of samples used for the weight update
    Global batch size  = *Replica batch size* x Number of replicas
    Global batch size  = (*Mini-batch size* x Gradient accumulation factor) x Number of replicas
"""
"""
#### How many samples will then be loaded in one step?

Considering you are iterating through the PopTorch DataLoader:

```python
for data, labels in training_data:
    training_model(data, labels)
```

For each step, the number of samples contained in `data` and `labels` will be:
***N = Global batch size x Device iterations***
"""
"""
## Tuning hyperparameters

### Evaluating the asynchronous DataLoader
"""
"""
How can we make sure the DataLoader is not a bottleneck for our model
throughput? In this tutorial we made an example benchmark to answer this
question:

1. As we will often measure time we will prepare a context manager which will
   capture the elapsed time of a code block:

"""


class catchtime:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.seconds = time.time()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):
        self.seconds = time.time() - self.seconds
"""

2. Evaluate the asynchronous DataLoader throughput without the IPU.

   We just loop through the DataLoader without running the model so we can
   estimate its maximum throughput.

"""
steps = len(training_data)
with catchtime() as t:
    for i, (data, labels) in enumerate(training_data):
        a, b = data, labels

print(f"Total execution time: {t.seconds:.2f} s")
items_per_second = (steps * device_iterations * batch_size * replicas) / t.seconds
print(f"DataLoader throughput: {items_per_second:.2f} items/s")

training_data.terminate()
"""

   > ***Note about releasing resources***:
   >
   > In the Jupyter environment, we have to manually detach from IPU devices
   > and terminate worker threads of the asynchronous data loader. Workers
   > must be manually terminated because we use the asynchronous data loader
   > (`DataLoaderMode.Async`) with a number of data samples not exactly
   > divisible by the total of batch size multiplied by device count. This
   > mismatch leaves some workers waiting to provide data which might not be
   > needed with the training epoch ending before all samples are exhausted.
   > In a production model, running from Python, this should not be necessary.

3. Evaluate the IPU throughput with synthetic data. To do so we will evaluate
   the model with synthetic data generated by the IPU. Create a new
   `poptorch.Options()` structure, this time specifying
   `enableSyntheticData(True)`:

"""
opts = poptorch.Options()
opts.deviceIterations(device_iterations)
opts.replicationFactor(replicas)
opts.enableSyntheticData(True)
# sst_hide_output
"""

When using synthetic data, no data is copied onto the device. Hence, the
throughput measured will be the upper bound of IPU/model performance.

Provided that the asynchronous DataLoader throughput is greater or equal than
this upper bound, the host-side data loading will not be a bottleneck. Else,
there is a risk that the DataLoader throughput is limiting performance of the
model.

Note that this is only true if you're using an asynchronous DataLoader, the
synchronous one can still slow down the overall execution as it will be run
serially.

> ***Note for IPU benchmarking***:
>
> The warmup time can be avoided by calling `training_model.compile(data,
> labels)` before any other call to the model. If not, the first call will
> include the compilation time, which can take few minutes.
>
> ```python
> # Warmup
> print("Compiling + Warmup ...")
> training_model.compile(data, labels)
> ```

### What if the DataLoader throughput is too low?
"""
"""
You can:

- Try using the asynchronous mode of `poptorch.DataLoader`;
- Try to increase the global batch size or the number of device iterations;
- Increase the number of workers;
- If you are using the asynchronous mode to load a small number of elements
  per step, you can try setting `miss_sleep_time_in_ms = 0` (See below).
"""
"""
Suggestions if the performance drops at the beginning of an epoch:

- Re-use workers by setting the DataLoader option `persistent_workers=True`;
- Make sure `load_indefinitely` is set to `True` (the default value);
- If the first iteration includes a very expensive operation (like opening or
  loading a large file) then increasing the `buffer_size` (size of the ring
  buffer) combined with the options above might help hide it at the cost of
  using more memory;
- Set the option `early_preload=True`. This means the data accessor starts
  loading tensors immediately once it's being built (whereas usually it will
  wait for an iterator to be created: for instance, when you enter the main
  loop).

  If the DataLoader is created before the model compilation is called, the data
  will be ready to be used when the compilation is over. The main drawback is
  that more RAM will be used on host as the data accessor and the compilation
  will work at the same time.

  > The options `miss_sleep_time_in_ms`, `early_preload`, `load_indefinitely`
  > and `buffer_size` are specific to the AsynchronousDataAccessor. They will
  > need to be passed to the DataLoader via the dictionary `async_options`:
  >

  > ```
"""
"""
### Device iterations vs global batch size
"""
"""
Even if we made sure the DataLoader is not a bottleneck any more, the strategy
we used for batching can be suboptimal. We must keep in mind that increasing
the global batch size will improve the IPU utilisation while increasing device
iterations will not.
"""
"""
#### Case of a training session
"""
"""
We have seen that the device can efficiently iterate while taking data prepared
by the CPU in a queue. However, one iteration implies gradient computation and
weight update on the device. The backward pass is computationally expensive.
Then, for training it is recommended to prefer bigger global batch size over
many device iterations in order to maximise parallelism.
"""
"""
#### Case of an inference session
"""
"""
For inference only, there is no gradient computation and weights are frozen.
In that case increasing the number of device iterations and using a smaller
global batch-size should not harm.
"""
"""
#### Conclusion: Training and inference sessions

Finally, as a general recommendation these two parameters have to be tuned so
your DataLoader can consume the whole dataset in the smallest number of steps
without throttling.
We can get this number of steps just by getting the length of the DataLoader
object:

```python
steps = len(training_data)
```
"""
"""
For an IterableDataset, the whole dataset is not necessarily consumed. With the
`drop_last` argument, elements of the dataset may be discarded. If the batch
size does not properly divide the number of elements per worker, the last
incomplete batches will be discarded.
