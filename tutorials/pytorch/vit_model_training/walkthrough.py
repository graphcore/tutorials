# Training a Hugging Face model on the IPU using a local dataset

This PyTorch tutorial will show you how to reuse a Hugging Face model and train it on the IPU using a local dataset.
Specifically, we will be fine-tuning a Vision Transformer (ViT) model to detect multiple diseases from chest X-rays. As an X-ray image can have multiple diseases we will be training a multi-label classification model.
We will use [Graphcore's Optimum interface](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore) to the [Hugging Face Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) to run an existing model on the IPU.
We will be using the [google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuning it on the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:
- Repurpose one of the examples from the [Graphcore organisation page on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore) to fit your use case.
- Preprocess a dataset to fit it to an existing model.
- Use the Graphcore model cards found on the [Graphcore organisation page on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore) and reuse checkpoints and config files released by Graphcore.
- Maximise IPU utilisation for your specific machine by overriding runtime parameters in the `IPUconfig` object made available in the model cards.

If this is your first time using IPUs, read the [IPU Programmer's Guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/3.1.0/) to learn the basic concepts.
To run your own PyTorch model on the IPU see the [PyTorch basics tutorial](../basics), or to see all existing Graphcore models available from Hugging Face go to the [Graphcore organisation page](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore).

## How to run this tutorial

### Getting the dataset

This tutorial uses the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset downloaded from <http://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC>. Download the `/images` directory and unpack all images. You can use `bash` to extract the files:
```for f in images*.tar.gz; do tar xfz "$f"; done```.

Also download the `Data_Entry_2017_v2020.csv` file, which contains the labels. By default the tutorial expects the `/images` folder and `csv` file to be in the folder `chest-xray-nihcc`.

### Environment

Requirements:

- A Poplar SDK environment enabled (see the [Getting
 Started](https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/getting-started.html) guide for
 your IPU system)
- Python packages installed with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
"""
# %pip install -q -r requirements.txt
# sst_ignore_md
# sst_ignore_code_only
"""
To run the Python version of this tutorial:

1. Download and install the Poplar SDK. Run the `enable.sh` scripts for Poplar and PopART as described in the [Getting
  Started](https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/getting-started.html) guide for your IPU system.
2. For repeatability we recommend that you create and activate a Python virtual environment. You can do this with:
   a. create a virtual environment in the directory `venv`: `virtualenv -p python3 venv`;
   b. activate it: `source venv/bin/activate`.
3. Install the Python packages that this tutorial needs with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
"""
"""
To run the Jupyter notebook version of this tutorial:

1. Enable a Poplar SDK environment (see the [Getting
  Started](https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/getting-started.html) guide for
  your IPU system)
2. In the same environment, install the Jupyter notebook server:
   `python -m pip install jupyter`
3. Launch a Jupyter Server on a specific port:
   `jupyter-notebook --no-browser --port <port number>`
4. Connect via SSH to your remote machine, forwarding your chosen port:
   `ssh -NL <port number>:localhost:<port number>
   <your username>@<remote machine>`

## Graphcore Hugging Face models

Hugging Face provides convenient access to pre-trained transformer models.
The partnership between Hugging Face and Graphcore allows us to run these models on the IPU.

Hugging Face models ported to the IPU can be found on the [Graphcore organisation page on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore).
This tutorial uses the [Vision Transformer model](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/tree/main/examples/image-classification) fine-tuned using the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset, as an example to show how Hugging Face models can be trained with a local dataset on the IPU.

## Preparing the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset

For this tutorial, we are using the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, which contains radiological examinations for the diagnosis of lung diseases.
The examinations consist of square, grayscale, X-ray images of 224 pixels with corresponding metadata: Finding Labels, Follow-up #,Patient ID, Patient Age, Patient Gender, View Position, OriginalImage[Width Height] and OriginalImagePixelSpacing[x y].

We defined the locations of the downloaded images and the file with the labels to be downloaded in [Getting the dataset](#getting-the-dataset).

# Path to Data_Entry_2017_v2020.csv

"""
### Preparing the labels

We are going to train the Graphcore Optimum ViT model to predict the disease (defined by "Finding Label") from the  images.
"Finding Label" can be any number of 14 diseases or a "No Finding" label, which indicates that no disease was detected.
To be compatible with the `datasets` Hugging Face library, the text labels need to be transformed to N-hot encoded arrays representing the multiple labels which are needed to classify each image.
An N-hot encoded array represents the labels as a list of booleans, true if the label corresponds to the image and false if not.

First we identify the unique labels in the dataset:
"""
data = pd.read_csv(label_file)

# Converts the format of each label in the dataframe from "LabelA|LabelB|LabelC"
# into ["LabelA", "LabelB", "LabelC"], concatenates the
# lists together and removes duplicate labels
unique_labels = np.unique(
    data["Finding Labels"].str.split("|").aggregate(np.concatenate)
).tolist()

print(f"Dataset contains the following labels:\n{unique_labels}")
"""
Now we transform the labels into N-hot encoded arrays:
"""
label_index = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(unique_labels)}


def string_to_N_hot(string: str):
    true_index = [label_index[cl] for cl in string.split("|")]

    label[true_index] = 1
    return label


data["labels"] = data["Finding Labels"].apply(string_to_N_hot)
"""
When loading data using the `datasets.load_dataset` function, labels can be provided either by having folders for each of the labels (see ["ImageFolder" documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.3.2/en/image_process#imagefolder)) or by having a `metadata.jsonl` file ((see ["ImageFolder with metadata" documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.3.2/en/image_process#imagefolder-with-metadata))). As the images in this dataset can have multiple labels, we have chosen to use a `metadata.jsonl` file.
We write the image file names and their associated labels to the `metadata.jsonl` file.
"""
metadata_file = images_dir / "metadata.jsonl"
if not metadata_file.is_file():
    data[["Image Index", "labels"]].rename(
        columns={"Image Index": "file_name"}
    ).to_json(images_dir / "metadata.jsonl", orient="records", lines=True)
"""
### Create the dataset

We are now ready to create the PyTorch dataset and split it into training and validation sets.
This step converts the dataset to the [Arrow file format](https://arrow.apache.org) which allows data to be loaded quickly during training and validation ([about Arrow and Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.3.2/en/about_arrow)).

Performance of multi-label classification models can be assessed using the area under the  ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC_ROC). The AUC_ROC represents the ability of the model to separate the different diseases. A score of 0.5 means that it is
50% likely to get the correct disease and a score of 1 means that it is able to perfectly separate the diseases.
To add this metric to our model evaluation we define a `compute_metrics` function and load the metric from the `datasets` package.
The `compute_metrics` function takes the labels predicted by the ViT model and computes the area under the ROC curve.
The `compute metrics` function takes an `EvalPrediction` object (a named tuple with a predictions and `label_ids` field), and has to return a dictionary string to float.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we have shown how to train a Hugging Face model on the IPU using a local dataset.
To do this, we:
- loaded the local dataset using the Hugging Face `datasets` package,
- defined transforms to ensure the dataset was compatible with the model,
- defined the `IPUTrainer` class to allow the model to run on the IPU,
- ran the model.

The dataset required preprocessing before being compatible with the `datasets` package.
We needed to encode the labels as N-hot arrays to make them compatible with the `load_dataset` function.
To improve the training of the model, device parameters were loaded and customised in the `IPUConfig` object and hyperparameters were tuned in the `IPUTrainer` class.

You are now ready to use Graphcore and Hugging Face models for your own application.
To see all the Hugging Face models available for the IPU, see the [Graphcore organisation page](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore) and for more information about
how models are run please consult the [Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs) and the [Graphcore Optimum Library](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore).
For information on how to optimise models for the IPU see the [Memory and Performance Optimisation Guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/memory-performance-optimisation/).
Graphcore also provides reference implementations of model architectures for many applications in the [Graphcore examples repository](https://github.com/graphcore/examples) and in the [Graphcore Model Garden](https://www.graphcore.ai/resources/model-garden).
