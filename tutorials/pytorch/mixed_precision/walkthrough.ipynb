    "### Motives for half precision\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is stored in memory, and some formats to store that data require less\n",
    "memory than others. In a device's memory, when it comes to numerical data,\n",
    "we use either integers or real numbers. Real numbers are represented by one\n",
    "of several floating point formats, which vary in how many bits they use to\n",
    "represent each number. Using more bits allows for greater precision and a\n",
    "wider range of representable numbers, whereas using fewer bits allows for\n",
    "faster calculations and reduces memory and power usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning applications, where less precise calculations are acceptable\n",
    "and throughput is critical, using a lower precision format can provide\n",
    "substantial gains in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Graphcore IPU provides native support for two floating-point formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "- IEEE single-precision, which uses 32 bits for each number (FP32)\n",
    "- IEEE half-precision, which uses 16 bits for each number (FP16)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some applications which use FP16 do all calculations in FP16, whereas others\n",
    "use a mix of FP16 and FP32. The latter approach is known as *mixed precision*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to talk about real numbers represented\n",
    "in FP32 and FP16, and how to use these data types (dtypes) in PopTorch in\n",
    "order to reduce the memory requirements of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical stability\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric stability refers to how a model's performance is affected by the use\n",
    "of a lower-precision dtype. We say an operation is \"numerically unstable\" in\n",
    "FP16 if running it in this dtype causes the model to have worse accuracy\n",
    "compared to running the operation in FP32. Two techniques that can be used to\n",
    "increase the numerical stability of a model are loss scaling and stochastic\n",
    "rounding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loss scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "A numerical issue that can occur when training a model in half-precision is\n",
    "that the gradients can underflow. This can be difficult to debug because the\n",
    "model will simply appear to not be training, and can be especially damaging\n",
    "because any gradients which underflow will propagate a value of 0 backwards\n",
    "to other gradient calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard solution to this is known as *loss scaling*, which consists of\n",
    "scaling up the loss value right before the start of backpropagation to prevent\n",
    "numerical underflow of the gradients. Instructions on how to use loss scaling\n",
    "will be discussed later in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stochastic rounding\n",
    "\n",
    "When training in half or mixed precision, numbers multiplied by each other\n",
    "will need to be rounded in order to fit into the floating point format used.\n",
    "Stochastic rounding is the process of using a probabilistic equation for the\n",
    "rounding. Instead of always rounding to the nearest representable number, we\n",
    "round up or down with a probability such that the expected value after\n",
    "rounding is equal to the value before rounding. Since the expected value of\n",
    "an addition after rounding is equal to the exact result of the addition, the\n",
    "expected value of a sum is also its exact value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that on average, the values of the parameters of a network will be\n",
    "close to the values they would have had if a higher-precision format had been\n",
    "used. The added bonus of using stochastic rounding is that the parameters can\n",
    "be stored in FP16, which means the parameters can be stored using half as much\n",
    "memory. This can be especially helpful when training with small batch sizes,\n",
    "where the memory used to store the parameters is proportionally greater than\n",
    "the memory used to store parameters when training with large batch sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly recommended that you enable this feature when training neural\n",
    "networks with FP16 weights. The instructions to enable it in PopTorch are\n",
    "presented later in this tutorial."
