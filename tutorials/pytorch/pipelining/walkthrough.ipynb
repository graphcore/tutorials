    "\n",
    "- Use the PopTorch pipelining API to execute a model over multiple IPUs in parallel.\n",
    "- Partition a model into blocks (`poptorch.Block`) and group them into pipeline stages (`poptorch.Stage`).\n",
    "- Learn how gradient accumulation and device iteration hyperparameters impact performance.\n",
    "- Debug a multi-IPU model using a sharded execution schedule (`poptorch.ShardedExecution`).\n",
    "- Learn how to offload the optimiser tensors to save memory on device.\n",
    "- Use the [Popvision Graph Analyser](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/graph-analyser-userguide/en/3.11.2/introduction.html) to look at execution profiles and understand how pipelining impacts the scheduling of a model across IPUs.\n",

    "In this tutorial we achieved model parallelism on multiple IPUs with the PopTorch pipelining API.\n",
    "The model was partitioned to define the pipeline stages. Then, the pipelined execution strategy was set in the `poptorch.Options()` object.\n",
    "We generated profiles and used the Popvision Graph Analyser to visualise the execution trace and the memory usage on IPUs.\n",
    "The graph profiles help to identify imbalances between stages.\n",

    "Additionally, memory usage on the IPU was reduced at the expense of execution time by offloading optimiser-specific tensors to the host.\n",
