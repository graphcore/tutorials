    "## Introduction to TensorBoard and Data Logging\n",
    "### How does TensorBoard work?\n",
    "TensorBoard itself runs independently of any TensorFlow processes, so starting\n",
    "and stopping TensorBoard does not affect any TensorFlow processes that may be\n",
    "running. The reason that TensorBoard and TensorFlow are independent in this way\n",
    "is due to the method of data transfer between them. Rather than a client/server\n",
    "model as one might first expect, there is no direct communication between the\n",
    "two packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, TensorBoard monitors a **log directory** to which your TensorFlow\n",
    "program writes data in a format that is parsable to TensorBoard. So, getting\n",
    "TensorBoard running and ready to start displaying data from your TensorFlow\n",
    "program is as simple as just starting the Daemon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do I launch TensorBoard?\n",
    "If we go ahead and enter `tensorboard` into a terminal (on a machine that has a\n",
    "TensorFlow installation and `tensorboard` on your path), you will notice the\n",
    "following error.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error: A logdir or db must be specified. For example `tensorboard --logdir mylogdir` or `tensorboard --db sqlite:~/.tensorboard.db`. Run `tensorboard --helpful` for details and examples.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, TensorBoard will not start without a log directory (or,\n",
    "alternatively a SQLite DB) being provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this tutorial, we shall be using the\n",
    "`/tmp/tensorboard_example_logs` directory as our log directory. Let's go ahead\n",
    "and launch TensorBoard.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "tensorboard --logdir /tmp/tensorboard_example_logs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If all is well, then you should see output akin to the following on your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "TensorBoard 2.7.0 at http://<your-machine>.<your-domain>:6006/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you navigate to the address given in your terminal (in a browser of your\n",

    "\n",
    "### TensorBoard on a Remote Machine\n",
    "If you use a remote machine for your TensorFlow development, then there are a\n",
    "couple of options for accessing TensorBoard remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SSH Tunnelling\n",
    "The first (and more secure) approach is to setup an SSH tunnel to your remote\n",
    "machine, binding the remote TensorBoard port to a local port on your machine.\n",
    "For example, to setup a tunnel that binds the TensorBoard port `6006` to port\n",
    "`6006` on your local machine, you would execute the following (on your local\n",
    "machine).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh -L 6006:localhost:6006 <your-username>@<your-server>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, navigating with your web browser to `localhost:6006` should\n",
    "yield the screen shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exposing TensorBoard to the Network\n",
    "Alternatively, if you are on a secure network, you may start TensorBoard with\n",
    "the `--bind_all` argument, which will allow access on the port used (`6006` in\n",
    "this example) from within the machines subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatically Handling Log Directory Cleansing\n",
    "When developing a TensorFlow program it may sometimes be desirable to clear the\n",
    "current data displayed by TensorBoard and start fresh. Below is a simple\n",
    "function to handle this clean-up for us. The function\n",
    "`create_tensorboard_log_dir` first checks that we have access to the `/tmp`\n",
    "directory (recall, for this tutorial we are using the log directory\n",
    "`/tmp/tensorboard_example_logs`), then it deletes the old log directory (if it\n",

    "The `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard` callback provides a very useful data\n",

    "The Graphs page should look something like the following.\n",

    "The Distributions page in TensorBoard is another useful source of information\n",
    "for inspecting your model. As with the model graph, the data displayed on the\n",
    "Distributions page is generated by the `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard`\n",

    "![Alt Text](figures/conv_0_dists.png \"conv_0 Distributions\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots provided on the Distributions page provide statistical insight into\n",
    "your models parameters. In the above example, we see how the distribution of\n",
    "the weights and biases for our `conv_0` layer changes over time. Each line in\n",
    "the plot represents a percentile. The\n",

    "The Histograms page provides an alternative view of the data presented in the\n",

    "\n",
    "As with the plots on the Distributions page, the plots on the Histograms page\n",
    "allow us to inspect the statistical properties of our models parameters. You\n",
    "will see that there are multiple histograms stacked for each parameter,\n",
    "indexed by time-step. Similarly to the Distributions page, we can also here see\n",
    "how our model parameters have evolved over time. Hover the cursor over one of\n",
    "the plots to see the outline for a given time-step.\n",

    "*Perhaps it would be useful to compare the data presented in these plots with those in the Distributions page? Do they correspond as one might expect?*\n",

    "## Time Series\n",
    "The final page in TensorBoard that we will cover in this tutorial is the Time\n",
    "Series page. On this page you will see no new information or plots, however you\n",

    "## Using TensorBoard Without Keras\n",
    "Although in this tutorial we have focused on the use of TensorBoard with Keras,\n",
    "it is entirely possible to log data out to TensorBoard without using Keras and\n",
    "`tf.keras.callbacks.Callback` instances. It just may involve some extra\n",
    "implementation as we won't have useful tools like\n",
    "`tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard`. However, as we have seen, the actual logging\n",

    "\n",
    "*As an exercise, try to de-Keras-ify this model whilst keeping the same level of TensorBoard insight.*\n",

    "## To Conclude\n",
    "In conclusion, we have looked at TensorBoard and how it may be used with IPU\n",
    "TensorFlow. We have covered primarily the case in which we are using Keras,\n",
    "including how to write our own custom data logging callbacks via TensorFlow's\n",
    "summary ops (`tf.summary`). We have also seen the wealth of information\n",
    "available to us by simply logging data using a built in callback\n",
    "(`tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard`). Finally, we took a brief tour of the\n",
    "TensorBoard interface and how to interpret some of the data presented to us\n",
