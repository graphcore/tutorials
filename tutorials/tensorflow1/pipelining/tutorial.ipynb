    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow on IPU supports two methods for model parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Model Parallelism With Sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "With model sharding, the model is split into stages where each stage can fit and be run on a single IPU. The output of each stage is fed to the input of the stage that follows it. Execution of the model is serialised. That is, each stage is executed in turn while the IPUs allocated to other stages remain idle.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sharding outline](images/sharding_outline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Refer to the technical note on TensorFlow Model Parallelism for full details:\n",
    "[TensorFlow Model Parallelism - Sharding](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tf-model-parallelism/en/latest/sharding.html#sharding)\n",
    "\n",
    "Model sharding provides a method to run larger models that is conceptually straightforward and might be useful for initial development or debugging. However, it does not offer good utilisation of the allocated IPU resource and, for this reason, sharding is not recommended for production models where performance is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Model Parallelism With Pipelining\n",
    "\n",
    "With pipelining, as with sharding, the model is split into stages where each stage can fit and be run on a single IPU. However, unlike sharding, the compute for separate batches is overlapped so that execution of the model is parallelised. That is, each stage (part of the original model) is executed on its IPU while the IPUs allocated to previous stages are already working on subsequent batches. This provides improved utilisation compared to sharding.\n",

    "Pipelining provides a method to run larger models that is conceptually less straightforward compared to sharding. However, it offers better utilisation of the allocated IPU resource and, for this reason, pipelining is recommended where performance is critical.\n",

    "### Pipeline Execution Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand the key phases of pipeline execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ramp up - the pipeline is being filled; work is flowing into each stage until all stages are filled (all IPUs are busy).\n",
    "2. Main execution - all stages are filled and IPU utilisation is maximised.\n",
    "3. Ramp down - the pipeline is being drained; work is flowing out of each stage until all stages are empty (no IPUs are busy).\n",
    "4. Weight updates - all pipeline batches have been processed, so accumulated gradients can be processed (gradient descent) and weights updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each individual batch passed through the pipeline is called a **mini-batch**.\n",
    "- Weights are updated only once a set of mini-batches has been fully processed.\n",
    "- Gradients are accumulated across a set of mini-batches.\n",
    "- Weight updates are applied once all the complete set of mini-batches are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, pipelining enforces **gradient accumulation** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "`effective batch size` = `mini-batch size` * `gradient accumulation count`\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing gradient accumulation is valid because summing the gradients across all the examples in a batch immediately and accumulating them over several steps are equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the gradient accumulation count has these benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A smaller proportion of time is spent in the ramp up and ramp down - that is, more time is spent in the main execution phase where maximum utilisation of the IPUs is made.\n",
    "- Fewer overall weight updates are made, which saves compute time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the pipeline outline extended to show the progress of 16 mini-batches followed by a weight update. Notice that the best utilization of the IPUs is during the main phase and that this is sustained until the last mini-batch enters the pipeline, following which the ramp down begins. Also notice that weight updates are only applied once, following the ramp down (after the pipeline has been drained of all mini-batches.)\n",

    "    name=\"Pipeline\")\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, the key parameters are described here inline:\n",
    "\n",
    "`computation_stages`: a list of Python functions, where each function represents a computational pipeline stage. Each function takes the outputs of the previous pipeline stage as its inputs.\n",
    "`gradient_accumulation_count`: the number of times each pipeline stage will be executed.\n",
    "`repeat_count`: the number of times the pipeline will be executed for each session run() call.\n",
    "`inputs`: arguments passed to the first pipeline stage.\n",
    "`infeed_queue`: optional IPUInfeedQueue, if passed, it is dequeued and passed as an input in the first pipeline stage.\n",
    "`outfeed_queue`: IPUOutfeedQueue, required if the last computational stage has any outputs. The outputs of these are enqueued to this queue and they can be accessed on the host.\n",
    "`optimizer_function`: optional Python function which takes the output of the last computational stage as parameters and returns an instance of pipelining_ops.OptimizerFunctionOutput in order to generate the back-propagation and weight-update parts of the model suitable for training.\n",
    "`pipeline_schedule`: which scheduling algorithm to use for pipeline lowering. Defaults to PipelineSchedule.Grouped (See [the Scheduling section](#scheduling).).\n",

    "## Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "The precise sequencing of forward and backward passes for the mini-batches can be adjusted using the scheduling parameter pipeline_schedule. The differences are most significant when training and you may need to experiment to find which method works best for your model.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Sequential Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "When sequential scheduling is used, the pipelined stages are serialised so only one stage is being executed at any given point in time. This removes the overlapped execution and so reduces IPU utilisation in the same way that sharded parallelism does. It can be used during debugging of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sequential Scheduling](images/sequential_scheduling.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interleaved Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "When interleaved scheduling is used, the pipelined stages run forward and backward passes in an alternating pattern. IPU utilisation may not be as optimal since a forward pass usually requires fewer cycles than a backwards pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Interleaved Scheduling](images/interleaved_scheduling.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grouped Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "When grouped scheduling is used, then at any given point in time, the pipelined stages are either all running their forward pass or all running their backward pass. IPU utilisation is more likely to be balanced compared to interleaved scheduling since all IPUs are running either forward pass compute or backward pass compute. Memory requirements may go up when compared to interleaved scheduling to cover an increase in 'in-flight' mini-batches.\n",

    "Follow the first mini-batch from time step 1 through the pipeline. Observe that it completes its backwards pass at time-step 8.\n",

These tutorial examples keep the repeat count quite low.

    "# Further Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "This section calls out some additional features and parameters that can affect performance when pipelining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always refer to the technical note on TensorFlow pipelining for the most up-to-date and detailed information: [TensorFlow Model Parallelism - Pipelining](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tf-model-parallelism/en/latest/pipelining.html#pipelining)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recomputation\n",
    "\n",
    "When pipelining, the forward activations of each operation will be saved so that they are available to compute the gradients in the backwards pass. This may require significant memory. If IPU memory is limited, then _recomputation_ can be used to reduce the memory used to store activations. With recomputation enabled, activations are only saved for a selected subset of the forward operations. The activations which were not saved will be recomputed as part of the backwards pass. This saves IPU memory at the expense of requiring more compute. Pipelining can be used with a single IPU in order to use recomputation, where using recomputation allows a model and mini-batch size to fit that would otherwise be out-of-memory on the IPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the technical note on TensorFlow Model Parallelism for full details: [TensorFlow Model Parallelism - Pipelining Recomputation](<https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tf-model-parallelism/en/latest/pipelining.html#recomputation>)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Offloading\n",
    "\n",
    "If IPU memory is limited, then variable offloading can be used. This will store some variables and activations in Streaming Memory. This saves IPU memory at the expense of time to swap the data on and off the IPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the technical note on TensorFlow Model Parallelism for full details: [TensorFlow Model Parallelism - Pipelining Variable Offloading](<https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tf-model-parallelism/en/latest/pipelining.html#variable-offloading>)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient Accumulation Buffer Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradients will be accumulated in a buffer when pipelining. The datatype of this buffer can be controlled using the API's `gradient_accumulation_dtype` argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `None`: Use an accumulator buffer of the same TensorFlow `DType` as each variable.\n",
    "- A TensorFlow `DType`: Specify the type to use for all accumulation buffers (for example, `tf.float16` or `tf.float32`).\n",
    "- A Python `callable`: User provided callback to support a different `DType` for each variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default is `None` (use an accumulator buffer of the same `DType` as each variable). You may want to override this if you are training in float16 and you want to use a float32 accumulator buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the TensorFlow 1 API documentation for details: [TensorFlow1 Pipelining API](<https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tensorflow1-user-guide/en/latest/tensorflow/api.html#tensorflow.python.ipu.pipelining_ops.pipeline>)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to combine data parallelism with model parallelism by using the standard `CrossReplicaOptimizer`, which is used for training replicated models, in the pipeline optimiser function. In this case:\n",

    "`IPUPipelineEstimator` is a version of `IPUEstimator` that supports pipelining. These APIs handle many of the details of running on IPUs, such as placement of operations and tensors, graph compilation and usage of data feeds. The model function provided to the `IPUEstimator` API must return an instance of `IPUPipelineEstimatorSpec` that contains the information needed for execution including pipelining specific details such as the computational stages and the gradient accumulation count.\n",
