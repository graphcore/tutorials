    "# Data parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "Data parallelism techniques are essential to achieve a better throughput during execution.\n",
    "There are mainly two kind of data parallelism:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **intra-device data parallelism**. This is controlled by the **micro batch size**. When we use a ```micro_batch_size``` greater than one, the IPU executes the same program in parallel on the different samples of the micro batch. \n",
    "- **across-devices data parallelism**. We can also choose to run the same program on different devices, feeding the copies with different data. \n",
    "An efficient way to implement this is to use [**replication**](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/3.1.0/algorithmic_techniques.html?highlight=micro%20batch#replication). This executes the same program across multiple devices and provides collective operations for the replicas to communicate. The ```session.ir.replication_factor``` controls the total number of replicas, whatever they are used for (we will see other uses of replication). When using replicas only to implement data parallelism, this factor will be set equal to your ```data_parallel``` factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless otherwise specified, with the term data parallelism we will always imply data parallelism across different replicas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Replication\n",
    "\n",
    "Each program has an inner execution strategy, which can include multiple devices. \n",
    "For example, we can design a program that uses 2 IPUs for its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to understand that replication is always orthogonal to the inner structure of the program: if we choose to run a 2-IPUs program with 4 replicas, we will use ``` 2 * 4 = 8 ``` IPUs, since each replica will need 2 IPUs for its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "With data parallelism we can process more data simultaneously, but this comes with an additional **communication** cost.\n",
    "This communication is achieved by means of **replicated collective operations**. Replicated collective operations perform a tensor operation across replicas, while standard **collective operations** perform tensor operations across devices in a single replica for multi-IPUs programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Available collective operations can be found in ```popxl.ops.collectives```. For example, a ```replicated_all_reduce``` op takes a tensor on each replica, calculates the sum (other reduction options are available) across the replicas and then creates a new tensor on each replica holding that sum. An ```all_reduce``` op will do the same, but across IPUs within a single replica.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without data parallelism, a training step has the form\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "repeat:\n",
    "  # fwd and bwd can happen on multiple IPUs\n",
    "  calculate forward pass of model on micro_batch to compute loss \n",
    "  calculate backward pass of model to compute weight gradients\n",
    "  update weight using weight gradients\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With data parallelism the training program has extra collectives operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "repeat:\n",
    "  # fwd and bwd can happen on multiple IPUs\n",
    "  calculate forward pass of model on micro_batch to compute loss\n",
    "  calculate backward pass of model to compute weight gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "  # collectives: extra communication step, extra cost\n",
    "  obtain sum of gradients across all replicas\n",
    "\n",
    "  update weight using weight gradients\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model replica will run this program on different `micro-batches`, achieving data-parallelism.\n",

    "Sometimes the communication cost can be significant, in which case we may want to amortize it with larger batches. [Gradient accumulation](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/3.1.0/algorithmic_techniques.html?highlight=micro%20batch#gradient-accumulation) can be help in this regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient Accumulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now we have been updating the weights of the network after each micro batch.\n",
    "With [Gradient accumulation](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/3.1.0/algorithmic_techniques.html#gradient-accumulation) gradients are instead accumulated for ```N = gradient_accumulation``` micro batches before updating the weights. Accumulation may be summation, mean or running mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without gradient accumulation, a training step has the form\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "repeat: #train steps\n",
    "    load a micro batch \n",
    "    # process a micro batch\n",
    "    calculate forward pass of model on micro batch to get loss \n",

    "    # if replication\n",
    "    (obtain sum of gradients across all replicas)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    update weight using accumulated weight gradients\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each model replica processes ```micro_batch_size ``` samples per weight update.\n",
    "\n",
    "With gradient accumulation you instead have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "repeat: #train steps\n",
    "  zero accumulated weight gradients\n",
    "  repeat: # gradient accumulation\n",
    "    load a micro batch \n",
    "    # process a micro batch\n",
    "    calculate forward pass of model on micro batch to get loss \n",
    "    calculate backward pass of model to get current weight gradients\n",
    "    # accumulation step\n",
    "    add current weight gradients to accumulated weight gradients\n",
    "  #if replication\n",
    "  (obtain sum of gradients across all replicas)\n",
    "  update weight using accumulated weight gradients\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, each model replica processes ```micro_batch_size * gradient_accumulation``` samples per weight update, but samples are not loaded all at once. Only a ```micro_batch``` is loaded for each gradient accumulation step. This way, we can have larger batches still fitting in the device memory.\n",
    "For a given number of processed samples, the time cost of the training with or without gradient accumulation is the same: ``` device_time = time_per_sample * micro_batch_size * gradient_accumulation``` (equal if we have smaller ```micro_batches``` with ```gradient_accumulation > 1``` or a single large ```micro_batch``` with ```gradient_accumulation = 1```)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, from a memory perspective we have an advantage: since we don't have to load the full batch on the device, we can use larger batches and have a better throughput ( large batches are not always a good strategy from a training perspective though).\n",
    "For this same reason gradient accumulation can be used with data parallelism to amortize the communication cost: if more samples are processed, the communication cost is less relevant.\n",
    "Another use case for gradient accumulation is pipelining, which will be investigated in another tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking into account both data parallelism and gradient accumulation, the total number of samples that contribute to an optimizer step is\n",
