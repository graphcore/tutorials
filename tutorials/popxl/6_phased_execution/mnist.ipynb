In the context of `popxl.addons` batch serialisation, it's useful to consider remote buffers as if they were matrices, with rows corresponding to different phases that can share the same buffer (they need to have the same graph) and `steps` columns corresponding to the batch indices. Underneath this logical layout, each element at a position defined by row and column has its own entry in the underlying `popxl` remote buffer, consisting of `rows * steps` entries.\n",
