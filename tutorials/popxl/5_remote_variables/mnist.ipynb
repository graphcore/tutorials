    "# IPU Hardware\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to show two techniques that can be used to address memory issues.\n",
    "Before entering into the topic, we suggest you read the [IPU hardware overview](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/latest/about_ipu.html). Here we just give a very short overiew \n",
    "\n",
    "The building blocks for IPU pods are IPU-machines, which are systems of 4 connected IPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each IPU has 10 **IPU-links** to connect to other IPUs. Multiple links can connect two IPUs, in which case the data transfer is faster between these IPU with respect to others. \n",
    "In the M2000 machine, for example, the basic IPU machine has the following structure\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fig1: IPU links](images/ipu_links.png)\n",
    "**Figure 1:** *Ipu links*\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use replication you don't select the IPUs to be used for replicas. Given the required number of IPUs, the best option is chosen automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "The memory in an IPU-based machine is made up of **In-Processor-Memory** (SRAM) and **Streaming Memory**.\n",
    "![Fig2: IPU memory architecture](images/mem_arch.png )\n",
    "**Figure 2:** *IPU memory architecture*\n",
    "\n",
    "The In-Processor-Memory is the IPU’s local **SRAM** and is split between tiles. Each tile only has direct access to code and data living in its local memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Streaming Memory is made up of several **DDR memory chips** and is not directly accessible to the tiles. Reading/Storing data to the Streaming Memory happens through PCle links and Gateway links and is slower than chip-to-chip communication via IPU-links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that difference is important to understand how to efficiently apply the following techniques. \n",

    "# Replicated tensor sharding \n",
    "\n",
    "When we are using replication, some tensor may be the same across replicas. \n",
    "In order to save memory, we can choose to slice these tensors so that each replica only has ` num_elements/num_replicas` elements of the tensor, with extra padding if needed (read also [popART User Guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/popart-user-guide/en/latest/tensor_locations.html?highlight=replicated%20tensor%20sharding#replicated-tensor-sharding-rts)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is called [Replicated tensor sharding](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/latest/algorithmic_techniques.html#replicated-tensor-sharding).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the full tensors are required by the program you need to make use of `gather` collectives, hence sharding comes with extra communication cost. This communication will happen through IPU-links. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the full tensor is no longer in memory for the entire lifetime of the program, so the memory gain can be significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we implement data parallelism with replication, a lot of variables are duplicated: each replica is using exactly the same weights, and also the optimizer state is the same: these are typically good candidates for RTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see in the next section, RTS is commonly used together with remote variables because it can amortise its cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fig3: Replicated Tensor Sharding](images/rts.png)\n",
    "**Figure 3:** *Replicated Tensor Sharding*\n",
    "\n",
    "## RTS in popxl.addons\n",
    "Sharded tensors can be identified since they have a `meta_shape`, representing the shape of the original tensor. Hence, you can know if a tensor is sharded by checking if `t.meta_shape` is not `None`.\n",
    "The `shape` of a sharded tensor is always flattened, `(num_elements/num_replicas, )`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a layer with the ```addons.Module``` class, you can specify sharded inputs with the\n",
    "`module.add_replica_sharded_variable_input` method. This works just like `module.add_variable_input` but expects sharded variables. Even if the input is sharded, the full tensor will be initialised.\n",
    "\n",
    "An analogue function `add_replica_sharded_variable_input`  is available in `addons.variable_factory` if you are using `VariableFactories` outside the module context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To shard a tensor either `remote_replica_sharded_variable` or `ops.collectives.replicated_reduce_scatter(..., configure_output_for_replicated_tensor_sharding=True)` can be used. We will see both examples in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful function when dealing with sharded tensors is ```addons.rts.replica_sharded_spec(t: popxl.Tensor, threshold: int)```. If the tensor has more elements than threshold, it returns the appropriate `TensorSpec` for the shard."

    "# Remote Variables\n",
    "When the IPU memory is insufficient the Streaming Memory can be used to store data remotely.\n",
    "The ideal use case for the streaming memory is data which does not require frequent access, so that the communication cost can be amortised. \n",
    "Moreover, we can **shard** remote variables to make the transfer faster: in a way sharding a remote variable is equivalent to perform part of the transfer using the IPU-Links instead of remote transfer, increasing the effective bandwidth. \n",
    "\n",
    "To store data in the Streaming Memory we make use of **remote buffers** and **remote variables** (see also [remote variables in popxl](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/popxl/en/latest/api.html#remote-buffers))\n",
    "\n",
    "A remote buffer represents a data array in the Streaming Memory, and a remote variable is a tensor whose data is located at a certain position in a remote buffer (hence, in the Streaming Memory). \n",
    "\n",
    "A remote variable is always linked to a specific **entry** in a buffer, which tells where the variable starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below shows two different buffers, both with 2 entries but created with different tensor shapes, the first with a flat count of 4 elements and the second with 6. \n",
    "![Fig4: Remote buffers, entries and remote variables](images/remote_buffers.jpg)\n",
    "**Figure 4:** *Remote buffers, entries and remote variables*\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to actually use a remote variable in your program, you need to load the data from the buffer to the IPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `popxl`, remote buffers are created via ```remote_buffer(tensor_shape, tensor_dtype, entries)```.\n",
    "The remote buffer can be thought as an array of the given `tensor_dtype`  with `tensor_total_elements * entries` slots. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry corresponds to a different variable: indeed, when you create a remote variable you have to specify the buffer and the entry number: ```popxl.remote_variable(data, buffer, entry_number)```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, when you load or store a variable from a buffer you have to tell the entry number, because in this way we know where data for the variable is located\n",
    "```python\n",
    "loaded_x = ops.remote_load(buffer, entry_number)\n",
    "ops.remote_store(buffer, entry_number, loaded_x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Remote variables in popxl.addons\n",
    "In `popxl.addons` you typically manage `NamedTensors`. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can create `NamedRemoteBuffers` for a set of `NamedTensors` or `NamedVariableFactories` with \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "addons.named_buffers(named_tensors, entries, sharded_threshold)\n",
    "addons.named_variable_buffers(named_factories, entries, sharded_threshold)\n",
    "```\n",
    "respectively.\n",
    "These functions create a buffer for each VariableFactory or NamedTensors, with the specified entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the shape is so that `nelms >= sharded_threshold`, a replica sharded RemoteBuffer will be created instead.\n",
    "`entries > 1` can be useful if you have multiple instances of the same layer. You can create buffers for all the layer variables specifying `entries = layers_copies` and access variables for the different copies by changing the entry number. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the `NamedRemoteBuffers` you can create a graph to load variables with  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "load_graph, names = load_remote_graph(buffers: NamedRemoteBuffers, entries: int = 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function returns a `GraphWithNamedArgs` and a list of names.\n",
    "The resulting graph has no named inputs and it requires the `entry_index` as input: `load_graph.call(0)` returns the remote variable stored at index 0 in the remote buffer.\n",
    "The `entries` argument can be provided to resize each buffer as needed, in case you want to enlarge your buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, you can create a graph to store variables into buffer after you have updated them with \n",
    "```python\n",
    "store_graph = store_remote_graph(buffers: NamedRemoteBuffers, entries: int = 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The graph has a named input for each buffer provided, with the tensor shape of the buffer.  It needs to be bound before calling it.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "store_graph.bind(w0).call(0)\n",
    "```\n",

    "In the example below we illustrate these concepts."
