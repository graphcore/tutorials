# Tutorial 3: writing vertex code

In this tutorial we will look at how compute steps are built up from
running pieces of work (the *vertices* of the compute graph) in parallel
as *compute sets*. The process for constructing compute sets described
here is the same method that the PopLibs libraries use. To learn more
about vertices, please refer to our [Poplar and PopLibs User Guide:
Understanding
Vertices](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poplar-user-guide/en/3.1.0/vertices_overview.html).

## Setup

In order to run this tutorial on the IPU you will need to have a Poplar
SDK environment enabled (see the [Getting Started Guide for your IPU
system](https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/getting-started.html)).

You will also need a C++ toolchain compatible with the C++11 standard,
build commands in this tutorial use GCC.

## Writing vertex code

Using `tut3_vertices/start_here` as your working directory, open
`tut3.cpp` in an editor. This file has an outline program like tutorial
2, but does not use the PopLibs libraries. Instead, we will write the
device code for the vertices in C++.

The program initially adds two 4-element vectors to the graph (`v1` and
`v2`). The code we are going to add will set each element of `v2` to the
suffix sum of `v1`. So `v2[0]` will contain the sum of all the elements
of `v1`, `v2[1]` will contain the sum of the elements of `v1`, starting
at element 1, and so on.

## Creating a codelet

To implement this operation, we have to write some code to run on the
device, known as a *codelet*. A file is provided for this in the
tutorial directory, called `tut3_codelets.cpp`. Make a copy of this file
in your working directory.

- Add the following code to `tut3.cpp` after the graph object is created:

    ```c++
    // Add codelets to the graph
    graph.addCodelets("tut3_codelets.cpp");
    ```

This instructs the host program to load the device code into the graph
and compile it to run on the device.

Inside `tut3_codelets.cpp` is the outline of a codelet. Like all Poplar
codelets, it is a C++ class derived from the `poplar::Vertex` class,
with a single member function called `compute`. This function defines
the work done by the vertex. The `compute` function returns true to
indicate successful completion.

We'll add code to this vertex to take in a set of numbers and write out
the sum of those numbers.

- Alter the class in the codelets file, adding the following fields to the
    vertex definition:

    ```c++
    class SumVertex : public poplar::Vertex {
    public:
      // Fields
      poplar::Input<poplar::Vector<float>> in;
      poplar::Output<float> out;
    ```

The fields named `in` and `out` represent the vertex's connections to
external tensors. They are used in the body of the `compute` function to
read and write the tensor data being operated on.

- Fill in the body of the `compute` function to calculate the output as the sum
    of the inputs:

    ```c++
    // Compute function
    bool compute() {
      *out = 0;
      for (const auto &v : in) {
        *out += v;
      }
      return true;
    }
    ```

Note that the `out` field can be updated even if the destination tensor
is on another tile. This is because the vertex operates on a local copy
of the data. The final result is transferred to the destination tile in
the exchange phase after the compute is complete.

## Creating a compute set

Now that we have some device code, we can build a step to execute it and
add this to our control program. To do this, you need to:

1.  Create a compute set that defines the set of vertices that are
    executed in parallel at each step
2.  Add vertices to the compute set to execute the task
3.  Connect data to the vertices (in other words, define the *edges* of
    the graph)
4.  Set the tile mapping of the vertices

These are described in more detail below.

1.  **Create a compute set:** add the following declaration to the
    control program in `tut3.cpp`, after the code to initialise `v1`
    (the string argument is a debug identifier):

    ```c++
    ComputeSet computeSet = graph.addComputeSet("computeSet");
    ```

2.  **Add four vertices to the compute set:** add the following loop to
    the code, after the compute set definition. This passes the name of
    the class defined in the codelet, which will create an instance of
    that class for each vertex. Each vertex will output to a different
    element of `v2`.

    ```c++
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
      VertexRef vtx = graph.addVertex(computeSet, "SumVertex");
    }
    ```

    Note that the `"SumVertex"` argument specifies the type of vertex to
    use, in this case it's the one we defined in the
    `tut3_codelets.cpp` file that was loaded into the graph.

3.  **Define the connections:** add the following code to the body of
    the loop you just created. This connects the input and output
    variables to the vertices. By using tensor operators and the loop
    index, each vertex is connected to different tensor elements.

    ```c++
    graph.connect(vtx["in"], v1.slice(i, 4));
    graph.connect(vtx["out"], v2[i]);
    ```

4.  **Set the tile mapping:** Add the following code to the body of the
    same loop:

    ```c++
    graph.setTileMapping(vtx, i);
    ```

    Here, each vertex is mapped to a different tile.

## Executing the compute set

If you are using the IPU Model simulation and want to profile the
performance, you can set a cycle estimate for the vertex, if known. This
is the number of cycles it takes to execute the codelet on the IPU. Here
we set the cycle estimate to be 20 cycles.

```c++
graph.setPerfEstimate(vtx, 20);
```

After creating the compute set, the final task is to add a step to the
control program to execute the compute set:

- Add the following code (anywhere after the `prog` sequence has been defined,
    but before `v2` is printed):

    ```c++
    // Add step to execute the compute set
    prog.add(Execute(computeSet));
    ```

- Now you can compile and run the program. You do not need to compile the
    codelet because your program can load and compile the vertex at run time.

You should now see that the `v2` tensor has been updated to the expected
values:

```console
v2: [7.0000000 6.0000000 4.5000000 2.5000000]
```

You can also compile the vertex code from the command line, with the
`popc` command:

```console
$ popc tut3_codelets.cpp -o tut3_codelets.gp
```

You can then use the compiled code by loading it, instead of the source,
in your program:

```c++
// Add codelets to the graph
graph.addCodelets("tut3_codelets.gp");
```
