# Tutorial 1: programs and variables

Before starting this tutorial, take time to familiarise yourself with
the IPU's architecture by reading the [IPU Programmer's
Guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/3.1.0/programming_model.html).
You can learn more about the Poplar programming model in the
corresponding section of our documentation: [Poplar and PopLibs User
Guide: Poplar programming
model](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poplar-user-guide/en/3.1.0/poplar_programs.html#poplar-programming-model).

In this tutorial you will:

- learn about the structure of Graphcore's low level C++ Poplar library for
    programming on the IPU.
- learn how graphs, variables and programs can be used to execute computations
    on the IPU.
- learn how streams can be used to exchange data efficiently between the host
    CPU and the IPU.
- complete a small example program which communicates and adds data on the IPU.
- optionally you will run this program on the IPU hardware.

A brief [summary](#summary) and a list of additional resources are
included at the end this tutorial. Graphcore also provides tutorials
using Python deep learning frameworks [PyTorch](../../pytorch/) and [TensorFlow
2](../../tensorflow2/).

## Setup

In order to run this tutorial on the IPU you will need to have a Poplar
SDK environment enabled (see the [Getting Started Guide for your IPU
system](https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/getting-started.html)).

You will also need a C++ toolchain compatible with the C++11 standard,
build commands in this tutorial use GCC.

Using `tut1_variables/start_here` as your working directory, open
`tut1.cpp` in a code editor. The file contains the outline of a C++
program with a `main` function, some Poplar library headers and the
`poplar` namespace. In the rest of this tutorial, you will be adding
code snippets to the `main` function at the indicated locations.

## Graphs, variables and programs

Poplar programs are built of three main components:

- a graph, which targets specific hardware devices.
- variables, which are part of a graph and store the data on which an IPU can operate.
- a program, which controls the operations applied to the graph and to its variables.

### Creating the graph

All Poplar programs require a `Graph` object to construct the
computation graph. Graphs are always created for a specific target
(where the target is a description of the hardware being targeted, such
as an IPU). To obtain the target we need to choose a device.

By default, these Poplar tutorials use a simulated target. As a result,
they can run on any machine, even if it has no Graphcore hardware
attached. On systems with Graphcore accelerator hardware, the header
file `poplar/DeviceManager.hpp` contains API calls to enumerate and
return `Device` objects for the attached hardware. The simulated devices
are created with the `IPUModel` class, which mimics the functionality of
an IPU on the host. The `createDevice` method creates a new virtual
device to work with. Once we have this device, we can create a `Graph`
object to target it.

- Add the following code to the body of `main`:

    ```c++
    // Create the IPU Model device
    IPUModel ipuModel;
    Device device = ipuModel.createDevice();
    Target target = device.getTarget();

    // Create the Graph object
    Graph graph(target);
    ```

While the `IPUModel` provides a convenient way to build and debug Poplar
programs without using IPU resources it is not a perfect representation
of the hardware. As a result it is preferable to use an IPU if one is
available. A description of the limitations of the `IPUModel` is
provided in the [Poplar developer guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poplar-user-guide/en/3.1.0/poplar_programs.html#programming-with-poplar). Instructions on how to use the hardware with
this tutorial example is available in the last section of this tutorial:
[(Optional) Using the IPU](#optional-using-the-ipu).

### Adding variables and mapping them to IPU tiles

Any program running on an IPU needs data to work on. These are defined
as *variables* in the graph.

- Add the following code to create the first variable in the program:

    ```c++
    // Add variables to the graph
    Tensor v1 = graph.addVariable(FLOAT, {4}, "v1");
    ```

This adds one vector variable with four elements of type `float` to the
graph. The final string parameter, `"v1"`, is used to identify the data
in debugging/profiling tools.

- Add three more variables:
    - `v2`: another vector of 4 floats.
    - `v3`: a two-dimensional 4x4 tensor of floats.
    - `v4`: a vector of 10 integers (of type INT).

Note that the return type of `addVariable` is `Tensor`. The `Tensor`
type represents data on the device in multi-dimensional tensor form.
This type is used to reference the whole variable but, as we will see
later, it can also be used to reference partial slices of variables, or
data constructed from multiple variables.

Variables must be allocated to tiles. One option is to allocate the
whole variable to one tile.

- Add the following code:

    ```c++
    // Allocate v1 to reside on tile 0
    graph.setTileMapping(v1, 0);
    ```

Most of the time, programs actually deal with data spread over multiple
tiles.

- Add the following code:

    ```c++
    // Spread v2 over tiles 0..3
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 4; ++i)
      graph.setTileMapping(v2[i], i);
    ```

This calls `setTileMapping` on sub-tensors of the variable `v2` to
spread it over multiple tiles.

- Add code to allocate `v3` and `v4` to other tiles.

### Adding the control program

Now that we have created some variables in the graph, we can create a
control program to run on the device. Programs are represented as
sub-classes of the `Program` class. In this example we will use the
`Sequence` sub-class, which represents a number of steps executed
sequentially.

- Add this declaration:

    ```c++
    // Create a control program that is a sequence of steps
    program::Sequence prog;

    // Debug print the tensor to the host console
    prog.add(program::PrintTensor("v1-debug", v1));
    ```

Here, the sequence has one step that will perform a debug print (via the
host) of the data on the device.

Now that we have a graph and a program, we can see what happens when it
is deployed on the device. To do this we must first create an `Engine`
object.

- Add to the code:

    ```c++
    // Create the engine
    Engine engine(graph, prog);
    engine.load(device);
    ```

This object represents the compiled graph and program, which are ready
to run on the device.

- Add the following code after the engine initialisation to run the control program:

    ```c++
    // Run the control program
    std::cout << "Running program\n";
    engine.run(0);
    std::cout << "Program complete\n";
    ```

### Compiling the poplar executable

The first version of our `main` function is complete and ready to be
compiled.

- In a terminal, compile the host program (remembering to link in the Poplar
    library using the `-lpoplar` flag):

    ```console
    $ g++ --std=c++11 tut1.cpp -lpoplar -o tut1
    ```

- Then run the compiled program:

    ```console
    $ ./tut1
    ```

When the program runs, the debug output prints out uninitialised values,
because we allocated a variable in the graph which is never initialised
or written to:

```console
v1-debug: [0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000]
```

## Initialising variables

One way to initialise data in the graph is to use constant values:
unlike variables, constants are set in the graph at compile time.

- After the code adding variables to the graph, add the following:

    ```c++
    // Add a constant tensor to the graph
    Tensor c1 = graph.addConstant<float>(FLOAT, {4}, {1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5});
    ```

This line adds a new constant tensor to the graph whose elements have
the values shown.

- Allocate the data in `c1` to tile 0:

    ```c++
    // Allocate c1 to tile 0
    graph.setTileMapping(c1, 0);
    ```

- Now add the following to the sequence program, just before the `PrintTensor` program:

    ```c++
    // Add a step to initialise v1 with the constant value in c1
    prog.add(program::Copy(c1, v1));
    ```

Here we have used a predefined control program called `Copy`, which
copies data between tensors on the device. Copying the constant tensor
`c1` into the variable `v1` will result in `v1` containing the same data
as `c1`.

Note that the synchronisation and exchange phases of IPU execution
described in the [IPU Programmer's
Guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/3.1.0/programming_model.html)
are performed automatically by the Poplar library functions and do not
need to be specified explicitly.

If you recompile and run the program you should see the debug print of
`v1` shows initialised values:

```console
v1-debug: [1.0000000 1.5000000 2.0000000 2.5000000]
```

Copying can also be used between variables:

- After the `v1` debug print command, add the following:

    ```c++
    // Copy the data in v1 to v2
    prog.add(program::Copy(v1, v2));
    // Debug print v2
    prog.add(program::PrintTensor("v2-debug", v2));
    ```

Now running the program will print both `v1` and `v2` with the same
values.

## Getting data into and out of the device

Most data to be processed will not be constant, but will come from the
host. There are a couple of ways of getting data in and out of the
device from the host. The simplest is to create a read or write handle
connected to a tensor. This allows the host to transfer data directly to
and from that variable.

- Add code (before the engine creation instruction) to create read and write
    handles for the `v3` variables:

    ```c++
    // Create host read/write handles for v3
    graph.createHostWrite("v3-write", v3);
    graph.createHostRead("v3-read", v3);
    ```

These handles are used after the engine is created.

- Add the following code after the engine creation instruction:

    ```c++
    // Copy host data via the write handle to v3 on the device
    std::vector<float> h3(4 * 4, 0);
    engine.writeTensor("v3-write", h3.data(), h3.data() + h3.size());
    ```

Here, `h3` holds data on the host (initialised to zeros) and the
`writeTensor` call performs a synchronous write over the PCIe bus
(simulated in this case) to the tensor on the device. After this call,
the values of `v3` on the device will be set to zero.

- After the call to `engine.run(0)`, add the following:

    ```c++
    // Copy v3 back to the host via the read handle
    engine.readTensor("v3-read", h3.data(), h3.data() + h3.size());

    // Output the copied back values of v3
    std::cout << "\nh3 data:\n";
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
      std::cout << "  ";
      for (unsigned j = 0; j < 4; ++j) {
        std::cout << h3[i * 4 + j] << " ";
      }
      std::cout << "\n";
    }
    ```

Here, we are copying device data back to the host and printing it out.
When the program is re-compiled and re-run, this prints all zeros
(because the program on the device doesn't modify the `v3` variable):

```console
h3 data:
  0 0 0 0
  0 0 0 0
  0 0 0 0
  0 0 0 0
```

Let's see what happens when `v3` is modified on the device. We will use
`Copy` again, but also start to look at the flexible data referencing
capabilities of the `Tensor` type.

- Add the following code to create slices of `v1` and `v3` immediately
    after the creation of the host read/write handles for `v3`:

    ```c++
    // Copy a slice of v1 into v3
    Tensor v1slice = v1.slice(0, 3);
    Tensor v3slice = v3.slice({1,1},{2,4});
    ```

These lines create a new `Tensor` object that references data in the
graph. This does not create new state but just references parts of `v1`
and `v3`.

- Now add this copy program:

    ```c++
    prog.add(program::Copy(v1slice, v3slice));
    ```

This step copies three elements from `v1` into the middle of `v3`.
Re-compile and re-run the program to see the results:

```console
h3 data:
  0 0 0 0
  0 1 1.5 2
  0 0 0 0
  0 0 0
```

## Data streams

During training and inference of machine learning applications,
efficiently passing data from the host to the IPU is often critical to
enabling high throughput. The most efficient way to get data in and out
of the device is to use data streams (see the the [Poplar and PopLibs User Guide: data streams](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poplar-user-guide/en/3.1.0/poplar_programs.html#data-streams-and-remote-buffers)
for more information). In Poplar, data streams need to be created and explicitly
named in the graph; in the code snippets below we add a
first-in-first-out (FIFO) input stream, connect it to a memory buffer (a
vector of length 30), and we stream chunks of 10 elements of that buffer
to the device.

- Add the following code to the program definition:

    ```c++
    // Add a data stream to fill v4
    DataStream inStream = graph.addHostToDeviceFIFO("v4-input-stream", INT, 10);

    // Add program steps to copy from the stream
    prog.add(program::Copy(inStream, v4));
    prog.add(program::PrintTensor("v4-0", v4));
    prog.add(program::Copy(inStream, v4));
    prog.add(program::PrintTensor("v4-1", v4));
    ```

These instructions copy from the input stream to the variable `v4`
twice. After each copy, `v4` holds new data from the host.

After the engine is created, the data streams need to be connected to
data on the host. This is achieved with the `Engine::connectStream`
function.

- Add the following code after the creation of the engine:

    ```c++
    // Create a buffer to hold data to be fed via the data stream
    std::vector<int> inData(10 * 3);
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < 10 * 3; ++i)
      inData[i] = i;

    // Connect the data stream
    engine.connectStream("v4-input-stream", &inData[0], &inData[10 * 3]);
    ```

Here, we've connected the stream to a data buffer on the host, using it
as a circular buffer of data. Recompile and run the program again, and
you can see that after each copy from the stream, `v4` holds new data
copied from the host memory buffer:

```console
v4-0: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
v4-1: [10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19]
```

## (Optional) Using the IPU

This section describes how to modify the program to use the IPU
hardware. The only changes are needed are related to making sure an IPU
is available and acquiring it.

We will create a new file by copying `tut1.cpp` to
`tut1_ipu_hardware.cpp` and open it in an editor.

- Remove the import declaration:

    ```c++
    #include <poplar/IPUModel.hpp>
    ```

- Add these import declarations:

    ```c++
    #include <poplar/DeviceManager.hpp>
    #include <algorithm>
    ```

- Replace the following lines from the start of `main`:

    ```c++
    // Create the IPU Model device
    IPUModel ipuModel;
    Device device = ipuModel.createDevice();
    ```

    with this code:

    ```c++
    // Create the DeviceManager which is used to discover devices
    auto manager = DeviceManager::createDeviceManager();

    // Attempt to attach to a single IPU:
    auto devices = manager.getDevices(poplar::TargetType::IPU, 1);
    std::cout << "Trying to attach to IPU\n";
    auto it = std::find_if(devices.begin(), devices.end(), [](Device &device) {
       return device.attach();
    });

    if (it == devices.end()) {
      std::cerr << "Error attaching to device\n";
      return 1; //EXIT_FAILURE
    }

    auto device = std::move(*it);
    std::cout << "Attached to IPU " << device.getId() << std::endl;
    ```

This gets a list of all devices consisting of a single IPU that are
attached to the host and tries to attach to each one in turn until
successful. This is a useful approach if there are multiple users on the
host. It is also possible to get a specific device using its
device-manager ID with the `getDevice` function.

- You are now ready to compile the program:

    ```console
    $ g++ --std=c++11 tut1_ipu_hardware.cpp -lpoplar -o tut1_ipu_hardware
    ```

- Run the program to see the same results.

    ```console
    $ ./tut1_ipu_hardware
    ```

You can make similar modifications to the programs in the other
tutorials in order to use the IPU hardware.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we learnt how to build a simple application targeting
the Graphcore IPU using Poplar. We used the `Graph` object
to map tensors to specific tiles of the IPU and used the
`Sequence` class to define a program with simple operations.
Finally, we used data streams to pass data into the device and return
results of the operations back to the host CPU process. This process and
the classes used in this tutorial are summarised in the [Poplar and PopLibs User Guide: Using Poplar](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poplar-user-guide/en/3.1.0/poplarlib.html).

These three steps form the basis of Poplar applications and will be
reused in the next tutorials. In the [second
tutorial](../tut2_operations/README.md) you will learn to use the
`popops` library which streamlines the definition of graphs and programs
that include mathematical and tensor operations in Poplar.

To learn more about the programming model of the IPU discussed in this
tutorial you may want to consult the [IPU Programmer's Guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/3.1.0/programming_model.html) or alternatively the [Poplar and PopLibs User Guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poplar-user-guide/en/3.1.0/poplar_programs.html). For a detailed reference, consult
the [API
documentation](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/poplar-api/en/3.1.0/).
Graphcore also provides tutorials targeted at new users of the IPU using
common Python deep learning frameworks [PyTorch](../../pytorch/) and [TensorFlow
2](../../tensorflow2/).
