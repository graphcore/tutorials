# Optimising Temporary Memory Usage for Convolutions and Matmuls on the IPU

This directory contains the supporting code and tests for the [technical note on
setting available memory for convolutions and
matmuls](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/available-memory/en/3.0.0/).

Further information on memory optimisation can be found in our [memory and
performance optimisation
guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/memory-performance-optimisation/en/3.0.0/common-memory-optimisations.html).
